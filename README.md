# hxWebP

A Haxe/[OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org) library for using WebP files with  [libwebp 1.3.2](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp).

## Supported Features
Very barebones so far! Does the following:
- Decodes WebP files into Image/BitmapData to use in Lime/OpenFL.

## Supported Platforms 
WebP files are supported on the following platforms:
| OS | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | ‚úîÔ∏è (64-bit) |
| macOS | üöß |
| Linux | üöß |
| HTML5 | ‚úîÔ∏è (natively) |
| Android | üöß |
| macOS | üöß |

## Installation

Install hxWebP from either source:

* haxelib
   ```bash
   haxelib install hxWebP
   ```

* git
   ```bash
   haxelib git hxWebP https://github.com/Binpuki/hxWebP.git
   ```

## Usage

Add the library inside your Project.xml file.
```xml
   <haxelib name="hxWebP" if="windows || web" />
```

You can then use the ```webp.WebP``` class to decode files either from a specified path or binary data.
```haxe
   var bitmapFromFile:BitmapData = WebP.getBitmapData("assets/images/coolimage.webp");
```
```haxe
   var bitmapFromBytes:BitmapData = WebP.getBitmapDataFromBytes(Assets.getBytes("assets/images/coolimage.webp"));
```
